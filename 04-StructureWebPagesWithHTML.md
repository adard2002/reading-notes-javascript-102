    <h1>Structuring web pages with HTML</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML code?</h2>
        - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML code is made up of what are called elements, these elements are characters which live inside angled brackets. Elements are usually made up of two tags: one being the opening and the other being the closing. The closing tag usually has a forward slash before the characters inside the angled brackets. 
    <h2>Here are some HTML codes to help you get started</h2>
    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <td>Code</td>
            <td>What the code means or does</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</td>
            <td>Indicates anything between the tags are HTML code</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</td>
            <td>Anything between these tags should be everything that should be shown inside the webpage. The closing tag usually right before the html closing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</td>
            <td>Words between these tags is a main header</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</td>
            <td>Words between these tags is a sub header.(There are a total of 6 different sizes of headers)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</td>
            <td>Anything between these tags is a paragraph</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</td>
            <td>Anything between these tags goes onto the tag of the page on the top</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;</td>
            <td>Anything between these tags goes at the bottom or foot of the page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;br /&gt;</td>
            <td>Forces a break in for example, a paragraph</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;hgroup&gt;</td>
            <td>This groups together multiple headers so that they appear in one line</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;</td>
            <td>Contains an image</td>
        </tr>
    <h2>Introducing Attributes</h2>
        <h3>What are attributes?</h3>
        <p>Attributes tell us more about the code</p>
        - Example: 
        <p><p style="color:pinkText">Pink:</p> Attribute name</p>
        <p><p style="color:blueText">Blue:</p> Attribute value</p>
        - &lt;p&gt; <p style="color:pinkText">lang</p>="<p style="color:blueText">en-us</p>"&gt;Paragraph in English&lt;/p&gt;
    <h2>How do I get started with my HTML web page?</h2>
    <p>
        You are going to want to start out with a wireframe which is just how you want your webpage to look and how it's gonna be set up. When drawing out your wireframem you are going to want to make sure you include the navigation bar, logo, images, paragraphs etc. Get creative with it! 
    </p>
    <h2>Some ideas to help you brainstorm what you want your navigation bar to all include</h2>
    <p>
        Your nav bar can have home, search bar, drop downs to some of the stuff on your nav bar. 
        - Example: If you are making a page about cooking, you may want to have tabs in your nav bar such as; desserts, pastas, pizzas, etc. If you want some drop downs some ideas could be; if you want some under desserts you could have pie, cookies, cupcakes, etc. Just make the page your own! 
        Some ideas for designing your nav bar and personalizing it can be making when you hover your cursor over it have an arrow, or an underline indicating as to which page you are in at the moment.

    <h2>The journey of HTML</h2>
    <p style="color:blueText">HTML4</p> (released 1997)
    - Some codes are now be in css instead. Such as &lt;center&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, and &lt;strike&gt;. 
    <p style="color:blueText">XHTML 1.0</p> (released 2000)
    - It's purpose was to allow people to write new markup languages. It became so popular which made the creators decided HTML4  should be made to follow the rules of XML. Which let to the renaming to XHTML. Due to being updated and made to follow the rules of the XML, people had to follow some more strict rules with writing markup. There were some updates that helped people who were used to the old HTML version to transfer to the new one. Transitional XHTML 1.0 helped because it allowed for some of the old lines of code to be used.
    <p style="color:blueText">HTML5</p> (work in progress)
    - Don't need to close all tags
    - New elements and attributes will be available.
