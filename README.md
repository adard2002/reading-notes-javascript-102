# Hello, welcome to my 102 notes!

## I am going to keep myself in a Growth Mindset by;
1. Instead of saying "I won't ever be good at this" I'll say "I will be able to do this, it's just going to take a bit of work before I can get there"
2. If I see someone who is better than me at something I won't say "I'll never be able to get to the point they are at" we all start somewhere and it's ok to be a bit slower than others. Everyone has their own pace they go at.
3. Not everyone understands something right away. It just takes practice. Everyone has their own ways that they learn.
