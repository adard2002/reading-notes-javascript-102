# Programming with JS
## How do you write a script?
Writing a script is a lot like carefully reading a recipe for something you never made before. Or instructions for building something. It might be confusing and scary when you take a first look at it but if you go through each and every step carefully it will be a breeze.
### How to start writing a script
1. Think about what you want the script to achieve
2. Once you figure out what you want the final outcome to be you are going to want to write out each step of how the computer is going to get to that goal. Don't leave any step out, be very specific. They computer will only do what you tell it to do from first step to last. Be very thorough. You can use a flowchart to layout the individual steps.
3. And finally, coding each and every step. The steps need to be written in a way the computer will understand.

## Expressions and Operators
### What does an expression do?
An expression results in a single value. There are two types of expressions. 
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable: For the variable to have a purpose, it need to have a value. In this example you can see that this is done by using an assignment operator which is the equals sign
- var color = 'beige'
2. Expressions that have two or more values to return or result in a single value: This can be done by performing an operation such as 3 * 2 which will result in a single value of 6. Example below shows that the value of the area is now 6
- var area = 3 * 2;

### What does an Operator do?
Expressions rely on these operators because they allow us to create a value from 1 or more values. There are 5 different types of operators:
1. <u>Assignment Operators:</u> Assign a value to a variable, in the example the value of color is now beige. like we seen earlier.
- Example: color = 'beige';
2. <u>Arithmetic Operators:</u> This performs basic math. In the example it is shows that the area is now 6. This was shown earlier
- Example: area = 3 * 2;
3. <u>String Operators:</u> These combine two strings. In the example the result of greeting will be "Hi Molly" Whatever is in single quotes is called a string.
- Example: greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';
4. <u>Comparison Operators:</u> Compares two values and returns a true or false. In the example the value of buy is false.
- Example: buy = 3 > 5;
5. <u>Logical Operators:</u> Combines expressions and returns true or false. In the example the value of buy is now true.
- Example: buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 
### Arithmetic Operators
|       Name        |       Operator        |           Purpose                 |        Example       |        Result       |
|:------------------|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:--------------------:|--------------------:|
|     Addition      |          +            |   Adds one value to another       |         10+5         |          15         |
|    Subtraction    |          -            | Subtracts one value from another  |         10-5         |          5          |
|     Division      |          /            |      Divides two values           |         10/5         |          2          |
|   Multiplication  |          *            |     Multiplies two values         |         10*5         |          50         |
|     Increment     |          ++           |  Adds one to the current number   |  i = 10; or i ++;    |          11         |
|     Decrement     |          --           | Subtracts one from current number |  i = 10; or i -- i   |          9          |
