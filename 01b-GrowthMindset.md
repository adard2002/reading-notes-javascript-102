Intro to coding and software development

## Growth Mindset
* Growth Mindset is where you don't give up no matter what. You keep trying no matter what happens and when you keep trying you learn new things. Failing is a part of learning. Everyone messes up and it teaches us what doesn't work and what does. It's ok to mess up, some of us learn quicker than others but that doesn't mean you should give up on what you want to do. If someone else is better at something than you are it's ok. They were once a beginner too but they have had a lot of experience and that's all part of learning something new.
### Some ways to keep yourself in a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset
* Instead of saying "I can't do this" say "I *CAN* do this"
* Instead of giving up, keep trying! 
* Don't tell yourself you can't do something because with enough practice you will be a pro.

> Never give up on something that yuo can't go a day without thinking about. -Winston Churchill
