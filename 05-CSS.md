<h1>CSS</h1>
<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
- CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS allows you to put in a background image or color, placement of images, and just the overall design.
<h2>How does CSS work?</h2>
- CSS works by relating rules with HTML elements. The rules tell you how the specified elements will be shown. CSS rules contain 2 parts. 1 which goes on the outsite of the brackets which is called the <p style color="blueText">Selector</p>. And the <p style color="pinkText">Declaration</p>, which is whatever that is inside of the brackets. 
<p style color="blueText">Selector:</p> Tells which element(s) it's going to be applied to.
<p style color="pinkText">Declaration:</p> Tells how the element in the Selector is going to be displayed or styled. 
- Inside of the brackets are 2 parts of each Declaration: the <p style color="lightPurple">Property</p> and <p style color="greenText">Value</p>.
<p style color="lightPurple">Property:</p> Indicates which part you are changing, such as; font, color, width, height etc. 
<p style color="greenText">Value:</p> Indicates how you are going to change the property. For example if your changing the color you are going to put which color you want.
